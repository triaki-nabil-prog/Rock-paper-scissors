# Rock-paper-scissors

this will be my first javascript problem solving project 
after finishing this project i'll be able to effectively implement,
basic planing and understanding the problem at hand then using algorithmes and pseudo-coding while deviding the problem into pseudo problems
and pseudo codes that will eventualy lead to solving the actual bigger problem at hand .
creating comments that a computer can understand throgh the code,white using javascript syntax.
